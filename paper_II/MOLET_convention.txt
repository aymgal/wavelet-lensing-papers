- if x axis is not inverted (i.e. positive to the right)
-> convert e1 e2 to PA, then add 90 degrees and give the resulting PA to MOLET

- if x is inverted (i.e. positive to the left)
->?????


- shear and light/lens profiles behave the same way.

- MOLET convention is East-of-North


- MOLET (VKL) gaussian is major axis, lenstro is intermediate => r_eff_molet = sigma_lenstro * np.sqrt(q)
